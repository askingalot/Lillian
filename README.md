My attempt to understand language interpreters

    Goals:
        learn something
        Simple language
            To learn
            fewest possible concepts
            fewest possible keywords / operators
            little boilerplate
        First class functions
        Recursion
            Tail recursion???
        No mutation
        No classes / inheritance
        Interop with .NET
            How without classes or mutability?
            Call functions on static classes
            Some kind of special "mutable" keyword like F#?
