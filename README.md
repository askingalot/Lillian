My attempt to understand programming language interpreters by building one.



### Goals
* learn something
* Simple language
    * Easy to learn
    * few concepts
    * few keywords / operators
    * little boilerplate
* Statically typed
    * I'd like it to be structurally typed
* Functional
    * First class functions
    * Recursion
        * Tail recursion???
    * No mutation (or maybe *little* mutation) 
    * No classes / inheritance
* Objects
    * Named record-like objects (key/value)
    * Lists
    * Tuples
* Interop with .NET (big ???s)
    * How will this work without classes or mutability?
    * Call functions on static classes
    * Some kind of special "mutable" keyword like F#?


### Non-Goals *(I'm not trying to...)*
* Performance
* Multi-threading
* Custom virtual machine (using and abusing [Expressions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.expressions.expression(v=vs.110).aspx))


### Inspirations
* C#
* F#
* Erlang
* Python
* JavaScript

It should probably also be noted that I have no idea what I'm doing.
